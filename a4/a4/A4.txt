CISC 454 Assignment 4
Due April 9, 2021

You are to add code to a raytracer to do the following:

  Russian Roulette

  Pixel antialising with jittering

  Soft shadows from area light sources

See "YOUR CODE HERE" in the provided code.  You should only have to
modify scene.cpp and scene.h.

After getting your code working, create an interesting scene that uses
these effects.  You may use digital models from elsewhere and may use
3D editors to create your scene.  If you do that, the objects will
have to be in Wavefront (.obj) format.  Note that not all Wavefront
objects are parsable by the code here.

To Hand In

  Make a directory called 'a4'.  In that directory, put

    - all of the *.cpp and *.h files from your 'src' directory (just
      in case you modify something other than scene.cpp and scene.h).

    - a README.txt file with your name(s) and netID(s)

    - two screen captured images in PNG format showing your 
      interesting scene.  Name them image1.png and image2.png

  Create a zip archive of the a4 directory and submit it to OnQ.
