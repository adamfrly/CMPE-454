The features we implemented were the jiggling of train cars and procedural placement of trees in the scene.
Jiggling was done by adding a small translation in Train::draw to each car depending on how fast the train was moving (a maximum amount of jiggle was set so that the train wouldn't go crazy).
The trees were done by generating a grid of trees in the scene, and translating each by a randomly generated vector.

The physics model was done by with four key lines:
float t = spline->paramAtArcLength(pos);

	vec3 o, x, y, z;
	spline->findLocalSystem(t, o, x, y, z);
	
	speed -= SPEED_INC * (z * vec3(0, 0, 1));

	pos += speed * elapsedSeconds;

This model takes the SPEED_INC value, and scales it by the dot product between the train's direction and the "up" direction.
If the train is facing upwards, more speed will be subtracted in that frame, if the train is facing downward, speed will be added.
Originally, the z variable was normalized before being dotted, but through trial and error, we found that the un-normalized z made for more relaistic results.
